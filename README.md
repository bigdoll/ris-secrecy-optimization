# ris-secrecy-optimization
Optimizing Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) for secure wireless communications. This project implements advanced algorithms to enhance data rates and energy efficiency while ensuring secrecy in the presence of eavesdroppers. Features include Monte Carlo simulations, 3D visualization, and state-of-the-art optimization techniques (SFP &amp; AO).
